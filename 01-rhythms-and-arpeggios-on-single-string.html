<h2>Rhythms and arpeggios on single string</h2>
<p>Why rhythms first, you may ask? It's simple - any combination of notes articulated whichever way you'd like to makes no sense without time, without a rhythm. Actually rhythm is implied in just about everything and anything we play and is no less of an importance, as the notes that come with it are a vibration, thus a rhythm themselves.</p>
<h3>How to practice rhythms</h3>
<p>As with any pattern, it's best to start without a metronome, or time constraint in general. First, try to understand the pattern in your head and then try to clap or tap it with your hands, counting the beats aloud. Clapping will also warm up your hands, which is good for playing on your instrument. Once you have that down without any mistakes, take your instrument and transfer the pattern to it. I recommend you to record each part of the process. Work slowly and when you feel confident with the pattern at your own tempo, practice along with metronome set at low BPM and work in small increments towards the target tempo and actually even like 30% beyond it to have some headroom during live performance, which may cause you to under-perform due to circumstances like stress or technical difficulties. You should be able to play any rhythmic figure for 1 to 5 minutes with zero mistakes at any given BPM. Listen or watch the recording, find, analyze, isolate and correct the problematic part.</p>
<h3>What is a measure, rhythm and note?</h3>
<h4>Measure</h4>
<p>A measure, or perhaps more commonly called a bar, is a segment of time corresponding to specific number of beats. You can also think of it a as line segment divided into equal parts.</p>
<h4>Rhythm</h4>
<p>Rhythm is a regular, repeating pattern of notes of particular lengths. It is also the specific instance of a measure.</p>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>Note is a rhythmic and melodic notation that says how long and what should be played.</p>
<h4>Note lengths</h4>
<p>Notes not only say what should be played, but also for how long. There're notes of different lengths:</p>
<ul>
 <li>whole note - lasting for all the beats in a measure</li>
 <li>&#x1D13B;&nbsp; whole rest</li>
 <li>&#x1D15E;&nbsp; half note - lasting for half of beats in a measure</li>
 <li>&#x1D13C;&nbsp; half rest</li>
 <li>&#x2669;&nbsp; quarter note - lasting one beat in a measure</li>
 <li>&#x1D13D;&nbsp; quarter rest</li>
 <li>&#x266A;&nbsp; eighth note - lasting half of a beat</li>
 <li>&#x1D13E;&nbsp; eighth rest</li>
 <li>triplet note - lasting one third of a beat</li>
 <li>&#x1D161;&nbsp; sixteenth note - lasting one fourth of a beat</li>
 <li>&#x1D13F;&nbsp; sixteenth rest</li>
 <li>&#x1D162;&nbsp; thirtysecond note - lasting one fifth of a beat</li>
 <li>&#x1D140;&nbsp; thirtysecond rest</li>
 <li>. dot - dot prolongs length of the actual note by half of its duration</li>
</ul>
<p>For each of the note lengths, there's a corresponding silent note called a rest, where no actual note is produced. Silence. Silence is sometimes called the thirteenth note in music.</p>
<h4>Time signature</h4>
<p>Time signature has two components, numerator and denominator. Numerator says how many beats there're in a measure, while denominator says how long each of the beats lasts, thus their actual duration. The time signature can be found before the note staff in the musical sheet notation. Perhaps the most common time signature is 4/4 - four beats in a measure. Each beat can be represented by one or more notes in 4/4 time signature and their sum is equal to 1.</p>
<h4>How to count rhythm</h4>
<p>Counting of a rhythm is dictated by the actual note duration value and the tempo, therefore we often count like this:</p>
<ul>
 <li>whole note - one-e-and-a, which is good for low BPMs</li>
 <li>&#x1D13B;&nbsp; whole rest</li>
 <li>&#x1D15E;&nbsp;  half note - one-and-two-and, as if it were two quarter notes</li>
 <li>&#x1D13C;&nbsp; half rest</li>
 <li>&#x2669;&nbsp; quarter note - one, two, three, four...</li>
 <li>&#x1D13D;&nbsp; quarter rest</li>
 <li>&#x266A;&nbsp; eighth note - one-and, two-and, three-and, four-and...</li>
 <li>&#x1D13E;&nbsp; eighth rest</li>
 <li>triplet note - one-trip-let, two-trip-let...</li>
 <li>&#x1D161;&nbsp; sixteenth note - one-e-and-a, two-e-and-a...</li>
 <li>&#x1D13F;&nbsp; sixteenth rest</li>
 <li>&#x1D162;&nbsp; thirtysecond note - one-e-and-a-two, two-e-and-a-three...</li>
 <li>&#x1D140;&nbsp; thirtysecond rest</li>
 <li>. dot - depends on the actual note length</li>
</ul>
<h3>Most common rhythms</h3>
<h3>Note names on each string and fret</h3>
<p>Sooner or later, knowing names of the notes on each string will be to your advantage. Even if you can find given note by ear on the fretbaord, it's easier to transcribe and transpose music with this part of language of musical theory. You will find it easier to discuss music with musicians with a at least a basic knowledge of music theory.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend playing each note on a given string, listening to it first, then play it again pronouncing its name aloud and hum or sing it, simply trying to make any sound that will match the pitch of given note the third time you play it.</p> 
<p>The hashtags - # - are pronounced as 'sharp' and the b's - b - are pronounced as 'flat'. Let's start with notes that aren't sharps nor flats. Here are the strings and notes:</p>
<pre>
0|-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12-13-14-15-16-17-18-19-20-21-22-23-24-|
e|-f---g---a---b-c---d-----e--f-----g-----a-----b--c-----d-----e--| high
b|-c---d---e-f---g---a-----b--c-----d-----e--f-----g-----a-----b--|
g|---a---b-c---d---e-f-----g-----a-----b--c-----d-----e--f-----g--|
D|---e-f---g---a---b-c-----d-----e--f-----g-----a-----b--c-----d--|
A|---b-c---d---e-f---g-----a-----b--c-----d-----e--f-----g-----a--|
E|-f---g---a---b-c---d-----e--f-----g-----a-----b--c-----d-----e--| low
</pre>
<p>As you can see, some patterns emerged in a form of clusters of notes. The guitar is an instrument that contains quite few of them and it's worth noticing these and take advantage of them. You can see that starting on the zeroth fret, there are notes that are nor sharp nor flat. This pattern repeats on frets five, ten, twelve, seventeen, twenty two and twenty four.</p>
<p>More useful pattern though, is the one where the notes create what is called an octave interval - the interval where first and eighth noteis are the same, but different in pitch. Let's take a look at the low E string and the note e on the D string, second fret, for example. Same goes for every and each note on the fretboard. It's very well worth to acknowledge, learn and accommodate this pattern into your playing. Once you have learned all the notes and their octaves, you can move on to learn the sharps and flats and their octaves.</p>
<p>Let's learn the sharp and flat notes on the fretboard:</p>
<pre>
0|-01----02----03----04----05-06----07----08----09----10-11----12-13----14----15----16----17-18----19----20----21----22-23----24-|
e|-------f#/gb-------g#/ab----a#/bb-------------c#/db----d#/eb----------f#/gb-------g#/ab----a#/bb-------------c#/db----d#/eb----| high
b|-------c#/db-------d#/eb----------f#/gb-------g#/ab----a#/bb----------c#/db-------d#/eb----------f#/gb-------g#/ab----a#/bb----|
g|-g#/ab-------a#/bb----------c#/db-------d#/eb----------f#/gb----g#/ab-------a#/bb----------c#/db-------d#/eb----------f#/gb----|
D|-d#/eb-------f#/gb----------g#/ab-------a#/bb----------c#/db----d#/eb-------------f#/gb----g#/ab-------a#/bb----------c#/db----|
A|-a#/bb-------------c#/db----d#/eb-------------f#/gb----g#/ab----a#/bb-------------c#/db----d#/eb-------------f#/gb----g#/ab----|
E|-------f#/gb-------g#/ab----a#/bb-------------c#/db----d#/eb----------f#/gb-------g#/ab----a#/bb-------------c#/db----d#/eb----| low
</pre>
<p>Another interesting thing one may notice is, that the notes that are not sharp or flat are like the white keys on the keyboard or piano, and the sharp or flat notes are like the black keys. Each set of the notes, that can also be called pitches, have some interesting relationships that will be explained later in further detail. For now, let's just mention that the 'white keys' can form a natural major or minor scales and their modes, and the 'black keys' can form a pentatonic scale.</p>
<h3>LIST - Listen, Internalize, Sing, Transfer</h3>
<p>The LIST concept is historically a successful one. Maybe not so much these days, when everything is readily available and explained on youtube and the likes. The rumor goes that kids these days may not have well trained ears. Let's take a look at what it is all about.</p>
<h4>Listen</h4>
<p>This is probably the fun, or at least the pleasant part. If you want to learn any piece of music, or even a natural language, it's worth listening to the material first. Carefully. Try to recognize how many and what instruments are playing, including vocals and what those instruments play. It doesn't have to be perfect, just try to be more analytical before you start headbanging to your favorite part.</p>
<h4>Internalize</h4>
<p>Whatever part and instrument you are trying to learn, internalize it. That takes actually remembering that part and being able to recall it at any given moment. Usually the most memorable part, that can also be used for reconstructing rest of the song on a given instrument, is the melody. Melody are the actual notes and implies also rhythm.</p>
<h4>Sing</h4>
<p>In order to verify the previous step, you should be able to sing the given part. If you can sing the melody with high fidelity, that's achievement unlocked.</p>
<h4>Notice please that we haven't touched the instrument yet. And we should not, until the last part.</h4>
<h4>Transfer</h4>
<p>Yay, finally!. Alrighty, now grab your guitar and let's sing the notes and find them on the fretboard. It's not cheating if you have given part of the song playing along on repeat, as there're often repeated notes on different strings that have different color.</p>
<h3>Most common bass lines, melodies and harmonic progressions</h3>
<h3>Rhythmic workout</h3>
<p>Here you can find each and every possible combination of note lengths, ever. Just kidding.</p>
<p>These exercises are focused on playing on the down beat. Count loud as quarter notes and play only one beat every measure. Count even while you are playing these with a metronome - counting shifts you from the reactive domain to proactive domain where you actually (co)create things. Play these exercises on all strings.</p>
<h4>Quarter notes</h4>
<pre>
|1-2-3-4-|1-2-3-4-|1-2-3-4-|1-2-3-4-|
|0~~~~~~~|0~~~~~~~|0~~~~~~~|0~~~~~~~| start on the first beat every bar
|~~0~~~~~|~~0~~~~~|~~0~~~~~|~~0~~~~~| start on the second beat every 
|----0~~~|~~~~0~~~|~~~~0~~~|~~~~0~~~| start on the third beat every bar
|------0~|~~~~~~0~|~~~~~~0~|~~~~~~0~| start on the fourth beat every bar
|0~0~0~0~|0~0~0~0~|0~0~0~0~|0~0~0~0~| play each beat straight, one after another
</pre>
<p>Now, let's combine these exercises into one:</p>
<pre>
|1-2-3-4-|1-2-3-4-|1-2-3-4-|1-2-3-4-|
|0~~~~~~~|~~0~~~~~|~~~~0~~~|~~~~~~0~| start on different beat in each bar
</pre>
<p><b>Tip:</b> start to count in reverse - go from 4th to 1st beat, playing the same patterns.</p>
<p>Do not forget to practice with metronome towards the target tempo once you can do these two exercises for 1-5 minutes in a row at your own tempo. Next few exercises will be very similar, but with more rhythmic subdivisions.</p>
<h4>Eighth notes</h4>
<p>These exercises are focused on playing on the up beat. Count loud as eighth notes and play these on all strings.</p>
<pre>
|1-&-2-&-3-&-4-&|1-&-2-&-3-&-4-&|1-&-2-&-3-&-4-&|1-&-2-&-3-&-4-&|
|--0~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~0~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~0~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~0~~~~~~~~~~~~| start on the -and of one
|------0~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~0~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~0~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~0~~~~~~~~| start on the -and of two
|----------0~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~0~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~0~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~0~~~~| start on the -and of three
|--------------0|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~0|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~0|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~0| start on the -and of four
|0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0|0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0|0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0|0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0| play straight eighth notes
</pre>
<p>Again, let's combine the exercises above into one:</p>
<pre>
|1-&-2-&-3-&-4-&|1-&-2-&-3-&-4-&|1-&-2-&-3-&-4-&|1-&-2-&-3-&-4-&|
|--0~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~0~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~0~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~0| start on the -and of different beat in each bar
|0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~0~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~0~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~0~~~~~~~~| play every single eighth note, starting on different subdivision every bar
|~~~~~~~~0~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~0~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~0~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~0|
</pre>
<p>Apply the same tip as with the quarter note exercises.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> displace the eight notes in one or more bars to create interesting rhythmic figures.</p>
<h4>Triplets</h4>
<p>Next subdivision we're going to practice is triplets. Triplets are perceived as something special, when they really are not. They just divide one beat into three parts.</p>
<pre>
|1-e-&-2-e-&-3-e-&-4-e-&|1-e-&-2-e-&-3-e-&-4-e-&|1-e-&-2-e-&-3-e-&-4-e-&|1-e-&-2-e-&-3-e-&-4-e-&|
|0~0~0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|0~0~0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|0~0~0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|0~0~0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~| start on the first beat every bar
|------0~0~0~~~~~~~~~~~~|------0~0~0~~~~~~~~~~~~|------0~0~0~~~~~~~~~~~~|------0~0~0~~~~~~~~~~~~| start on the second beat every bar
|------------0~0~0~~~~~~|------------0~0~0~~~~~~|------------0~0~0~~~~~~|------------0~0~0~~~~~~| start on the third beat every bar
|------------------0~0~0|------------------0~0~0|------------------0~0~0|------------------0~0~0| start on the fourth beat every bar
|0~0~0-0~0~0-0~0~0-0~0~0|0~0~0-0~0~0-0~0~0-0~0~0|0~0~0-0~0~0-0~0~0-0~0~0|0~0~0-0~0~0-0~0~0-0~0~0| play the triplets on every beat in a bar
</pre>
<p>The exercises above could be a bit more challenging, as they require you to speed up your picking hand bit more than eighth notes, for example. To add to to the challenge though, let's do some basic accenting</p>
<pre>
|1-e-&-2-e-&-3-e-&-4-e-&|1-e-&-2-e-&-3-e-&-4-e-&|1-e-&-2-e-&-3-e-&-4-e-&|1-e-&-2-e-&-3-e-&-4-e-&|
|0~~~~------------------|0~~~~------------------|0~~~~------------------|0~~~~------------------| play just the first third of a triplet on the first beat every bar
|--0~-------------------|--0~-------------------|--0~-------------------|--0~-------------------| play just the second third of a triplet on the first beat every bar
|----0------------------|----0------------------|----0------------------|----0------------------| play just the third third of a triplet on the first beat every bar
</pre>
<p>Hard? Take your time, these are absolutely worth it. Once you are done with the accents on the first beat, shift them to rest of the beats in the bar and then apply all the previous tips, if possible.</p>
<p>Just when you think things cannot get harder, the next level comes down at you. Check out the next set of exercises.</p>
<pre>
|1-e-&-2-e-&-3-e-&-4-e-&|1-e-&-2-e-&-3-e-&-4-e-&|1-e-&-2-e-&-3-e-&-4-e-&|1-e-&-2-e-&-3-e-&-4-e-&|
|0~0--------------------|0~0--------------------|0~0--------------------|0~0--------------------| play the first and second third of a triplet on the first beat every bar
|--0~0------------------|--0~0------------------|--0~0------------------|--0~0------------------| play the second and third third of a triplet on the first beat every bar
|0~~~0------------------|0~~~0------------------|0~~~0------------------|0~~~0------------------| play the first and third third of a triplet on the first beat every bar
</pre>
<p>Again, once you done with the first beat, shift the same exercises to the remaining beats. Let's combine all these triplet-based exercises together in the next set of exercises.</p>
<pre>
|1-e-&-2-e-&-3-e-&-4-e-&|1-e-&-2-e-&-3-e-&-4-e-&|1-e-&-2-e-&-3-e-&-4-e-&|1-e-&-2-e-&-3-e-&-4-e-&|
|0~0~0------------------|------0~0~0------------|------------0~0~0------|------------------0~0~0| play the triplet on different beat every bar
|0~~~~------------------|--0~~------------------|----0~-----------------|0~0~0------------------| play the accent in different parts of the triplet every bar
|0~0--------------------|--0~0------------------|0~~~0------------------|--0~~~0----------------| play the accents in different parts of the triplet and beats every bar
|--0~0~0----------------|----0~0----------------|
</pre>
<p>After you finish these three exercises above, again apply all the previous tips, if possible.</p>
<h4>Sixteenth notes</h4>
<p>
<pre>
|1-e-&-a-2-e-&-a-3-e-&-a-4-e-&-a|1-e-&-a-2-e-&-a-3-e-&-a-4-e-&-a|1-e-&-a-2-e-&-a-3-e-&-a-4-e-&-a|1-e-&-a-2-e-&-a-3-e-&-a-4-e-&-a|
|0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0|0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0|0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0|0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0~0| play straight sixteenth notes every bar
|0~0~0~0~-----------------------|0~0~0~0~-----------------------|0~0~0~0~-----------------------|0~0~0~0~-----------------------| start on the first beat every bar
|--------0~0~0~0~---------------|--------0~0~0~0~---------------|--------0~0~0~0~---------------|--------0~0~0~0~---------------| start on the second beat every bar
|----------------0~0~0~0--------|----------------0~0~0~0--------|----------------0~0~0~0--------|----------------0~0~0~0--------| start on the third beat every bar
|------------------------0~0~0~0|------------------------0~0~0~0|------------------------0~0~0~0|------------------------0~0~0~0| start on the fourth beat every bar
