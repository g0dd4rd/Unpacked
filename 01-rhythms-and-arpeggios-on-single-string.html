<h2>Rhythms and arpeggios on single string</h2>
<p>Why rhythms first, you may ask? It's simple - any combination of notes articulated whichever way you'd like to makes no sense without time, without rhythm. Actually rhythm is implied in just about everything and anything we play and is no less of an importance as the notes that come with it are a vibration, thus a rhythm themselves.</p>
<h3>How to practice rhythms</h3>
<p>As with any pattern, it's best to start without a metronome, or time constraint in general. First, try to understand the pattern in your head and then try to clap it with your hands, counting the measures aloud. Once you have that down without any mistakes, take your instrument and transcribe the pattern to it. Work slowly and when you feel confident with the pattern at your own tempo, practice along with metronome set at low BPM and work in small increments towards the target tempo and actually even faster to have some headroom during live performance which may cause you to under-perform due to circumstances like stress or technical difficulties.</p>
<h3>What is a measure, rhythm and note?</h3>
<h4>Measure</h4>
<p>Measure, or perhaps more commonly called a bar, is a segment of time corresponding to specific number of beats. You can also think of it a as line segment divided to equal parts.</p>
<h4>Rhythm</h4>
<p>Rhythm is a regular repeating pattern of notes of particular lengths. It is also the specific instance of a measure.</p>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>Note is a rhythmic and melodic notation that says how long and what should be played.</p>
<h4>Note lengths</h4>
<p>Notes not only say what should be played, but also for how long. There're notes of different lengths:</p>
<ul>
 <li>whole note - lasting for all the beats in a measure</li>
 <li>half note - lasting for half of beats in a measure</li>
 <li>quarter note - lasting one beat in a measure</li>
 <li>eighth note - lasting half of a beat</li>
 <li>triplet note - lasting one third of a beat</li>
 <li>sixteenth note - lasting one fourth of a beat</li>
 <li>thirtysecond note - lasting one fifth of a beat</li>
</ul>
<p>For each of the note lengths, there's a corresponding silent note called a pause, where no actual note is produced. Pause is sometimes called the thirteenth note in music.</p>
<h4>Time signature</h4>
<p>Time signature has two components, numerator and denominator. Numerator says how many notes there're in a measure, while denominator says how long each of the notes should be played, thus their actual duration. Perhaps the most common time signature is 4/4 - four quarter notes in a measure.</p>
<h4>How to count rhythm</h4>
<p>Counting of a rhythm is dictated by the actual note duration value and the tempo, therefore we often count like this:</p>
<ul>
 <li>whole note - one-e-and-a, which is good for low BPMs</li>
 <li>half note - one-and-two-and, as if it were two quarter notes</li>
 <li>quarter note - one, two, three, four...</li>
 <li>eighth note - one-and, two-and, three-and, four-and...</li>
 <li>triplet note - one-trip-let, two-trip-let...</li>
 <li>sixteenth note - one-e-and-a, two-e-and-a...</li>
 <li>thirtysecond note - one-e-and-a-two, two-e-and-a-three...</li>
</ul>

<h3>Note names on each string and fret</h3>
<p>Sooner or later, knowing names of the notes on each string will be to your advantage. Even if you can find given note by ear on the neck, it's easier to write to transcribe and transpose. I strongly recommend playing each note on a given string, listening to it, pronouncing its name aloud and hum or sing it, simply trying to make any sound that will match the pitch of given note.</p> 
<p>The hashtags - # - are pronounced as 'sharp' and the b's - b - are pronounced as 'flat'. Let's start with notes that aren't sharps nor flats. Here are the strings and notes:</p>
<pre>
0|-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12-13-14-15-16-17-18-19-20-21-22-23-24-|
e|-f---g---a---b-c---d-----e--f-----g-----a-----b--c-----d-----e--| high
b|-c---d---e-f---g---a-----b--c-----d-----e--f-----g-----a-----b--|
g|---a---b-c---d---e-f-----g-----a-----b--c-----d-----e--f-----g--|
D|---e-f---g---a---b-c-----d-----e--f-----g-----a-----b--c-----d--|
A|---b-c---d---e-f---g-----a-----b--c-----d-----e--f-----g-----a--|
E|-f---g---a---b-c---d-----e--f-----g-----a-----b--c-----d-----e--| low
</pre>
<p>As you can see, some patterns emerged in a form of clusters of notes. The guitar is an instrument that contains quite few of them and it's worth noticing these and take advantage of them. You can see that starting on the zeroth fret, there are notes that are not sharp nor flat on all the strings. This pattern repeats on frets five, ten, twelve, seventeen, twenty two and twenty four.</p>
<p>The more useful pattern though, is the one where the notes create what is called an octave interval. Let's take a look at the low E string and the note e on the D string, second fret, for example. Same goes for every and each note on the fretboard. It's very well worth to acknowledge, learn and accommodate this pattern to your playing. Once you have learned all the notes and their octaves, you can move on to learn the sharps and flats and their octaves.</p>
<p>Let's learn the sharp and flat notes on the fretboard:</p>
<pre>
0|-01----02----03----04----05-06----07----08----09----10-11----12-13----14----15----16----17-18----19----20----21----22-23----24-|
e|-------f#/gb-------g#/ab----a#/bb-------------c#/db----d#/eb----------f#/gb-------g#/ab----a#/bb-------------c#/db----d#/eb----| high
b|-------c#/db-------d#/eb----------f#/gb-------g#/ab----a#/bb----------c#/db-------d#/eb----------f#/gb-------g#/ab----a#/bb----|
g|-g#/ab-------a#/bb----------c#/db-------d#/eb----------f#/gb----g#/ab-------a#/bb----------c#/db-------d#/eb----------f#/gb----|
D|-d#/eb-------f#/gb----------g#/ab-------a#/bb----------c#/db----d#/eb-------------f#/gb----g#/ab-------a#/bb----------c#/db----|
A|-a#/bb-------------c#/db----d#/eb-------------f#/gb----g#/ab----a#/bb-------------c#/db----d#/eb-------------f#/gb----g#/ab----|
E|-------f#/gb-------g#/ab----a#/bb-------------c#/db----d#/eb----------f#/gb-------g#/ab----a#/bb-------------c#/db----d#/eb----| low
</pre>
<p>Another interesting thing one may notice, is that the notes that are not sharp nor flat are like the white keys on the keyboard or piano, and the sharp or flat notes are like the black keys. Each set of the notes, that can also be called pitches, have some interesting relationships that will be explained later in further detail. For now, let's just mention that the 'white keys' can form a natural major or minor scales and their modes, and the 'black keys' can form a pentatonic scale.</p>
<h3>LIST - Listen, Internalize, Sing, Transfer</h3>
<p>The LIST concept is historically a successful one. Maybe not so much these days, when everything is readily available and explained on youtube and the likes and the rumor goes that kids these days may not have well trained ears. Let's take a look at what it is all about.</p>
<h4>Listen</h4>
<p>This is probably the fun, or at least the pleasant part. If you want to learn any piece of music, or even a natural language, it's worth listening to the material first. Carefully. Try to recognize howmany and what instruments are playing including vocals and what those instruments play. It doesn't have to be perfect, just try to be more analytical before you start headbanging.</p>
<h4>Internalize</h4>
<p>Whatever part and instrument you are trying to learn, internalize it. That takes actually remembering that part and being able to recall it at any given moment. Usually the most memorable part that can also be used to reconstruct rest of the song on a given instrument is the melody. Melody are the actual notes and implies also rhythm.</p>
<h4>Sing</h4>
<p>In order to verify the previous step, you should be able to sing the given part. If you can sing the melody with high fidelity, that's achievement unlocked.</p>
<h4>Notice please that we haven't touched the instrument yet. And we should not, until the last part</h4>
<h4>Transfer</h4>
<p>Yay, finally!. Alrighty, now grab your guitar and let's sing the notes and find them on the fretboard. It's not cheating if you have given part of the song playing along on repeat, as there're often repeated notes on different strings that have different color.</p>
