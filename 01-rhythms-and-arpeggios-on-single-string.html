<h2>Rhythms and arpeggios on single string</h2>
<p>Why rhythms first, you may ask? It's simple - any combination of notes articulated whichever way you'd like to makes no sense without time, without rhythm. Actually rhythm is implied in just about everything and anything we play and is no less of an importance as the notes that come with it are a vibration, thus a rhythm themselves.</p>
