<h2>Rhythms and arpeggios on single string</h2>
<p>Why rhythms first, you may ask? It's simple - any combination of notes articulated whichever way you'd like to makes no sense without time, without rhythm. Actually rhythm is implied in just about everything and anything we play and is no less of an importance as the notes that come with it are a vibration, thus a rhythm themselves.</p>
<h3>How to practice rhythms</h3>
<p>As with any pattern, it's best to start without a metronome, or time constraint in general. First, try to understand the pattern in your head and then try to clap it with your hands, counting the measures aloud. Once you have that down without any mistakes, take your instrument and transcribe the pattern to it. Work slowly and when you feel confident with the pattern at your own tempo, practice along with metronome set at low BPM and work in small increments towards the target tempo and actually even faster to have some headroom during live performance which may cause you to under-perform due to circumstances like stress or technical difficulties.</p>
<h3>What is a measure, rhythm and note?</h3>
<h4>Measure</h4>
<p>Measure, or perhpas more commonly called a bar, is a segment of time corresponding to specific number of beats.</p>
<h4>Rhythm</h4>
<p>Rhythm is a regular repeating pattern of notes of particular lengths. It is also the specific instance of a measure.</p>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>Note is a rhythmic and melodic notation that says how long and what should be played.</p>
<h4>Note lengths</h4>
<p>Notes not only say what should be played, but also for how long. There're notes of different lengths:</p>
<ul>
 <li>whole note - lasting for all the beats in a measure</li>
 <li>half note - lasting for half of beats in a measure</li>
 <li>quarter note - lasting one beat in a measure</li>
 <li>eighth note - lasting half of a beat</li>
 <li>triplet note - lasting one third of a beat</li>
 <li>sixteenth note - lasting one fourth of a beat</li>
 <li>thirtysecond note - lasting one fifth of a beat</li>
</ul>
<p>For each of the note lengths, there's a corresponding silent note called a pause, where no actual note is produced. Pause is sometimes called the thirteenth note in music.</p>
<h4>Time signature</h4>
<p>Time signature has two components, numerator and denominator. Numerator says how many notes there're in a measure, while denominator says how long each of the notes should be played, thus their actual duration. Perhaps the most common time signature is 4/4 - four quarter notes in a measure.</p>
<h4>How to count rhythm</h4>
<p>Counting of a rhythm is dictated by the actual note duration value and the tempo, therefore we often count like this:</p>
<ul>
 <li>whole note - one-e-and-a, which is good for low BPMs</li>
 <li>half note - one-and-two-and, as it was two quarter notes</li>
 <li>quarter note - one, two, three, four...</li>
 <li>eighth note - one-and, two-and, three-and, four-and...</li>
 <li>triplet note - one-trip-let, two-trip-let...</li>
 <li>sixteenth note - one-e-and-a, two-e-and-a...</li>
 <li>thirtysecond note - one-e-and-a-two, two-e-and-a-three...</li>
<ul>
