<h2>Rhythms and arpeggios on single string</h2>
<p>Why rhythms first, you may ask? It's simple - any combination of notes articulated whichever way you'd like to makes no sense without time, without rhythm. Actually rhythm is implied in just about everything and anything we play and is no less of an importance as the notes that come with it are a vibration, thus a rhythm themselves.</p>
<h3>How to practice rhythms</h3>
<p>As with any pattern, it's best to start without a metronome, or time constraint in general. First, try to understand the pattern in your head and then try to clap it with your hands, counting the measures aloud. Once you have that down without any mistakes, take your instrument and transcribe the pattern to it. Work slowly and when you feel confident with the pattern at your own tempo, practice along with metronome set at low BPM and work in small increments towards the target tempo and actually even faster to have some headroom during live performance which may cause you to under-perform due to circumstances like stress or technical difficulties.</p>
