<h2>11 - Chords, rhythms and arpeggios</h2>
<h3>How to practice chords</h3>
<p>First, as always, it's a listening exercise. Fret the chord, strum it or play with any technique you want, press a little harder or little less than usual or bend it up or down, but listen to it carefully. It should not buzz, unless that is your intention. Every note should be articulated clearly at even volume. Play different voicings of the chord (same note at the base, but different order for the remaining notes above it) and play its inversions (different notes at the base)  and their voicings too. Muscle memory - even though it doesn't seem to exist, it's a term used for the ability to think about a chord and fretting it without spending too much time on it. So, how to learn to fret a chord the most effective way?</p>
<h4>Technique mechanics</h4>
<p>First, pay to attention to your wrist angle - it shouldn't be bent much, ideally it remains straight, aligned with your forearm. Second, pay attention to position of your thumb - where it is on the neck both vertically and horizontally and how and if it supports your fingers while fretting different chords. Avoid RSI - you should not feel any pain the next day.</p>

 <li>Look at where each finger should be located</li>
 <li>Fret the chord, pressing little harder than usual</li>
 <li>Hold and play the chord (any technique you want with your picking hand) for 15 - 30 seconds</li>
 <li>Release, relax the fretting hand taking it off the neck entirely for 10 seconds</li>
 <li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 for 4 to 8 times per chord shape</li>
</ol>
<h3>Chord qualities</h3>
<p>The order of intervals determines the chord quality. There are following chord qualities:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Major</li>
 <li>Dominant</li>
 <li>Minormajor</li>
 <li>Minor</li>
 <li>Half-diminished</li>
 <li>Diminished</li>
 <li>Augmented</li>
 <li>Sustained 2</li>
 <li>Sustained 4</li>
</ul>
<h3>Major chord</h3>
<p>The major chord can be derived from the natural major scale by collecting its 1st, 3rd, 5th and in case of a seventh chord also the 7th degree:</p>
<pre>
bb c d eb f gb a bb
1    3    5    7
</pre>
<p>Thus, for example Bbmaj7 chord is a collection of bb, d, f a notes.</p>
