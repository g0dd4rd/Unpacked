<h2>10 - Harmonizing scales - chord theory, circle of 4ths/5ths - all 12 keys</h2>
<p>Scales are great, but how they relate to chords? Let's take a look at our friend - the natural major scale, or the ionian mode. If we wanted to know what chords can be created using this scale, comprising its key, we just have to take the first, third and fifth tone, also called a scale degree and repeat that for every and each. We will do just that and also take a look at the intervals involved.</p>
<pre>
natural major scale / ionian mode
1   3   5
c d e f g a b c
c e g -> 3 b3 -> C major 
</pre>
<p>We took the first, third and fifth degree of the C natural major scale, or ionian mode, which gives us tones c, e and g. The distance between tones c and e is called an interval of majord third, the distance between e and g is called an interval of minor (flat) third. These three tones together give us the C major chord. Chord is a combination of three or more tones. Major chord is made of combination of a major third as its first  interval and minor third as its second interval. The minor third is three semitones or frets and the major third is four semitones on the fret board. The chord derived from the first degree is called the tonic.</p>
<p>Next, we will derive rest of the chords in the scale.</p>
<pre>
  1   3   5
c d e f g a b c
d f a -> b3 3 -> D minor
</pre>
<p>This time, we started counting on d and we got tones d f and a, the d and f creating a minor third interval and f and a creating a major third interval. This specific combination of minor and major third intervals gives us a minor chord. Notice that this combination is the exact opposite of a major chord. The chord we obtained is D minor. Let's continue.</p>
<pre>
</pre>
    1   3   5
c d e f g a b c
e g b -> b3 3 -> E minor
</pre>
<p>We've got again a minor chord, called E minor. So far we have a C major derived from the first degree, D minor derived from the second degree and E minor derived from the third degree of ionain mode, or natural major scale.</p>
<pre>
      1   3   5
c d e f g a b c
f a c -> 3 b3 -> F major
</pre>
<p>From the fourth degree, we've got again a major chord. Chord derived from the fourth degree is called a subdominant.</p>
<pre>
        1   3   5
c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c
g b d -> 3 b3 -> G major
</pre>
<p>On the fifth degree, we've got a major chord, called a dominant.</p>
<pre>
          1   3   5
c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c
a c e -> b3 3 -> A minor
</pre>
<p>On the sixth degree, we have a minor chord. If we start the scale or the key from this degree, we will get a relative minor scale or key of this major scale.</p>
<pre>
            1   3   5
c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c
b d f -> b3 b3 -> B half-diminished
</pre>
<p>This time, on the seventh degree, we've got sort of a special chord called half-diminished, comprising of two minor third intervals. This chord can sound dissonant and is often used as a passing chord (in-between chord), creating tension.</p>
<p>Here's everything in one table:</p>
<pre>
C natural major scale / ionian mode
c d e f g a b c
c e g -> 3 b3 -> C major
d f a -> b3 3 -> D minor
e g b -> b3 3 -> E minor
f a c -> 3 b3 -> F major
g b d -> 3 b3 -> G major
a c e -> b3 3 -> A minor
b d f -> b3 b3 -> B hdim
</pre>
<p>Notice how the chords move the notes vertically and diagonally (from left to top) , from the first, third and fifth degree. This movement is called voice leading, more obvious with seventh chords - chords that contain also the seventh degree of a scale.</p>
<h3>Voice leading</h3>
<p>is a concept where we move the harmony incrementaly in as short steps as possible, often moving through the harmony just by one semitone on any string at a time. The typical vehicles for voice leading are the thirds and sevenths together with fifths in between.</p>
