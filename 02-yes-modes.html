<h2>02 - Yes, modes</h2>
<p>Before we delve into a particular mode, it'd be fair to listen to them first. You can then learn the one you like the most as first. Below are the modes written out from the same root note, so that you can hear their character the best. You can also start and continue with different mode each time and see how that affects your perception of the modes. Simply experiment.</p>

<h3>Modes</h3>
<p>Modes? What are modes? Every scale is a mode. But let's rather think about modes as scales, as modes may freak out some of us. Every scale has a structure that gives the scale its character. The structure is denoted by distance between the tones or pitches, that is described as semitones, steps or intervals. The first scale we will look at is called a chromatic scale.<p>
<h4>Chromatic scale</h4>
<p>The chromatic scale contains all twelve semitones, denoting the whole octave from the root note to the same root note, but octave higher. That's it - just twelve tones, it's all we have in the western music. There's a pause or rest, often called the thirteenth tone and very important one. We can also create microtones with different techniques such as vibrato.</p>

<h3><a href="#02-how-to-practice-scales-and-intervals">How to practice scales and intervals</a></h3>
<p>First take your time and listen to whatever scale or arpeggio you're trying to learn. Have undisturbed, focused listening session, if possible. Second, try to sing the material first with the recording and then without it. The last step is transferring it to the instrument. You can try and really just follow your voice and find the notes on the instrument, or take bit of a shortcut and learn some common patterns. It's good to practice the pattern on one string in three or five noted chunks and then more strings the same way. In other words, work the pattern both vertically and horizontally. Once you have the pattern down and you can play it without any mistake for at least three minutes, try and improvise with it in the rhythms from first chapter of this book, or just completely freely on your own. After you feel comfortable, try to improvise the pattern over different chords - your favorite song for example, to have some harmonic context. This should give you enough freedom and prepare yourself for real jam.<p>
<h3><a href="#02-technique-mechanics">Technique mechanics</a></h3>
<p>When it comes to playing, we often use almost too much pressure. This can lead to RSI, bad intonation (tones are out of tune) and slowing us down in general. So how much pressure should we apply?</p>
<p>Just enough to get the tone out without any buzz. How do we achieve that, though?</p>
<ol>
 <li>Just lightly touch the strings, outlining what you want to play wth your fretting hand and pick the muted strings with your right hand</li>
 <li>Repeat step 1, just pressing slightly more on the strings so they start buzzing while picking them</li>
 <li>Finally, repeat step 1, but this time press just enough to produce the correct tone and pitch</li>
</ol>
<p>Repeat any of the steps or the whole exercise how many times you need to play with just the right amount of pressure.</p>
<h4>Intervals</h4>
<p>The concept of an intervals as distance between two notes is the basic building block in music theory. Intervals, in general, tend to decide if what we hear sounds pretty or ugly. It's often enough to highlight just the characteristic intervals that make up a scale / mode or a chord. For example, in the classical western music, the chords are built from major and minor thirds. Below is an overview of intervals and some of their characteristics.</p>
<pre>
Name:          - Order: -  Distance in semitones: - Example: - Shortcut:
prima / root   - first  -  0                      - c-c      - R
minor second   - second -  1                      - c-db     - b2
(major) second - third  -  2                      - c-d      - 2
minor third    - fourth -  3                      - c-eb     - b3
(major) third  - fifth  -  4                      - c-e      - 3
(perf.) fourth - fifth  -  5                      - c-f      - 4
flat fifth     - sixth  -  6                      - c-gb     - b5, #4
(perf.) fifth  - seventh-  7                      - c-g      - 5
minor sixth    - eighth -  8                      - c-ab     - b6, #5
(major) sixth  - ninth  -  9                      - c-a      - 6
minor seventh  - tenth  - 10                      - c-bb     - b7
(major) seventh- eleventh 11                      - c-b      - 7
(perf.) octave - twelveth 12                      - c-c1     - 8

<p>Arguably the most important intervals are the thirds, fifths and sevenths that define the scale or chord qualities the most and are used for voice leading. There's a math connected to intervals that comes handy while doing certain operations with them, such as putting one interval on top of another or inverting them. When it comes to invervals, there's a magic number - 9.</p>
<p><em>Interval arithmetic</em></p>
<pre>
Interval: Inversion: Magic:
prima     octave     9 - 1  
second    seventh    9 - 2
third     sixth      9 - 3
fourth    fifth      9 - 4
fifth     fourth     9 - 5
sixth     third      9 - 6
seventh   second     9 - 7
