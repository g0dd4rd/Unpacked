<h2>Scales and intervals on different string sets</h2>
<p>In this chapter, we're going to cover quite a bit of ear training, technique, improvisation and theory. Get ready!</p>

 <li>Yes, modes</li>
 <li>Scales (natural, harmonic, melodic: major, minor, dominant, half-diminished)</li>
 <li>Scales in intervals (odd groupings, too)</li>
 <li>Harmonizing scales - chord theory, circle of 4ths/5ths - all 12 keys</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to practice scales and intervals</h3>
<p>First take your time and listen to whatever scale or arpeggio you're trying to learn. Have undisturbed, focused listening session, if possible. Second, try to sing the material first with the recording and then without it. The last step is transferring it to the instrument. You can try and really just follow your voice and find the notes on the instrument, or take bit of a shortcut and learn some common patterns. Once you have the pattern down and you can play it without any mistake for at least three minutes, try and improvise with it in the rhythms from first chapter of this book, or just completely freely on your own. After you feel comfortable, try to improvise the pattern over different chords - your favorite song for example, to have some harmonic context. This should give you enough freedom and prepare yourself for real jam.<p>
